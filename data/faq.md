### Product Information and Compatibility

**1. What types of books does Inkwell & Quill Books sell?**

Inkwell & Quill Books offers a curated selection of new and gently used books across a wide range of genres, including fiction, non-fiction, children's literature, young adult, historical fiction, mystery, thriller, science fiction, fantasy, biography, history, self-help, and more. We specialize in high-quality literature and aim to provide a diverse and engaging collection for every reader.

**2. Do you sell e-books or audiobooks?**

Currently, Inkwell & Quill Books primarily focuses on physical books. We believe in the tactile experience of reading a printed book. However, we are always evaluating our offerings and may introduce digital formats in the future. Please subscribe to our newsletter for updates on any new product lines.

**3. How do you determine the condition of your used books?**

We have a rigorous grading system for our used books to ensure transparency and customer satisfaction. Our categories include:

*   **Like New:** Appears to have been read once or not at all. May have a very minor shelf wear.
*   **Very Good:** May show some signs of wear, but in excellent condition overall. Binding is tight, pages are clean, and no significant markings or damage.
*   **Good:** May have noticeable shelf wear, minor creasing on the spine or covers, or slight foxing (age spots) on pages. All pages are present, and the book is perfectly readable.
*   **Acceptable:** Shows significant signs of wear, such as creased spine, dog-eared pages, or minor staining. However, the book is complete and readable.

Each used book listing includes a detailed description of its specific condition.

**4. Are your new books hardcover or paperback?**

We offer both hardcover and paperback editions for many of our new titles. The format will be clearly indicated in the product description on each book's page. You can usually filter search results by format if you have a preference.

**5. Can I request a specific book that you don't currently have in stock?**

Yes! We are always looking to expand our collection based on customer demand. You can use our "Book Wishlist" feature on your account page to request titles. While we cannot guarantee we will be able to source every request, we will certainly do our best and notify you if we add it to our inventory.
