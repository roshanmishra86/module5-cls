## Inkwell & Quill Books - Comprehensive Return & Exchange Policy

At Inkwell & Quill Books, we are committed to providing you with high-quality books and a delightful shopping experience. We understand that sometimes a purchase may not be exactly what you're looking for, and we've outlined our return and exchange policies below to ensure a smooth and fair process for all our valued customers.

**1. Standard Return Periods:**

We offer different return periods based on the type of product you've purchased:

*   **New Books (Hardcover & Paperback):** You may return new books in their original, saleable condition within **30 days** of the purchase date.
*   **Used Books:** Used books may be returned within **14 days** of the purchase date, provided they are in the same condition as when purchased. Minor shelf wear consistent with being a used book is acceptable.
*   **Audiobooks (Physical CDs/Vinyl):** Physical audiobook formats may be returned within **30 days** of the purchase date, provided the packaging is unopened and the discs are in their original sealed state.
*   **E-books & Digital Content:** Due to the nature of digital products, e-books and digital content are generally **non-returnable** once downloaded or accessed. Please refer to Section 6 for exceptions.
*   **Stationery & Gifts (Journals, Notebooks, Pens, Book Accessories, etc.):** These items may be returned within **30 days** of the purchase date, provided they are in their original, unopened packaging and in saleable condition.
*   **Event Tickets & Signed Editions:** Tickets for Inkwell & Quill Books events and specially marked "Signed Editions" are typically **final sale** and non-returnable, unless the event is cancelled or the signed item is demonstrably damaged upon arrival. Please check the product description for specific details.

**2. Condition Requirements for Returns:**

To be eligible for a return, all items must meet the following conditions:

*   **New Books:** Must be in **new, unread, and undamaged condition**. This includes:
    *   No creases on the spine or pages.
    *   No writing, highlighting, or underlining on any page.
    *   No torn, bent, or dog-eared pages.
    *   The dust jacket (if applicable) must be intact and undamaged.
    *   The cover should be free from scratches, dents, or marks.
    *   Any shrink-wrap or protective packaging must be intact if the item was sold with it.
*   **Used Books:** Must be returned in the **same condition** as received. This means:
    *   No new damage incurred since purchase (e.g., water damage, significant rips, missing pages).
    *   Minor shelf wear, slight tanning of pages, or very light cover scuffing consistent with being a previously owned book are generally acceptable.
    *   Any identifying marks or labels from Inkwell & Quill Books (e.g., price stickers) must be present.
*   **Stationery & Gifts:**
    *   Must be in their **original, unopened packaging**. This applies to items like sealed stationery sets, boxed pens, or accessories still in their factory sealed containers.
    *   If packaging was removed but the item is still in pristine, unused condition (e.g., a journal with no writing or damage, a pen with its cap and no ink on the nib), it may be accepted at the discretion of Inkwell & Quill Books, but may be subject to a restocking fee (see Section 7).

**3. Exchange Procedures:**

If you wish to exchange an item for a different title, edition, or product, please follow these steps:

*   **Gift Cards:** Gift cards are non-returnable and cannot be redeemed for cash.
*   **Personalized or Custom-Ordered Items:** Any books or merchandise that have been personalized or custom-ordered are non-returnable unless there is a defect in production or damage during shipping.

**7. Restocking Fees (Where Applicable):**

Inkwell & Quill Books reserves the right to charge a restocking fee in the following circumstances:

*   **Returns of Opened Stationery & Gifts:** If stationery or gift items are returned in opened, but otherwise pristine and saleable condition (i.e., not in their original sealed packaging), a **15% restocking fee** may be applied. This fee covers the cost of inspection and repackaging.
*   **Returns Outside Standard Conditions (at Manager's Discretion):** In rare cases, if an item is returned slightly outside of the described condition requirements but is deemed acceptable by management, a restocking fee may be applied to cover additional processing.
*   **Exceptions:** Restocking fees are **waived** for:
    *   Items returned due to manufacturing defects or damage during shipping.
    *   Inkwell & Quill Bookworms Loyalty Program members.
    *   Exchanges for items of equal or greater value.

**8. International Return Procedures:**

For customers outside of our primary shipping regions, please note the following regarding returns and exchanges:

*   **International Shipping Costs:** Customers are responsible for all shipping costs associated with returning items from international locations, including any customs duties, taxes, or fees incurred. Inkwell & Quill Books will not reimburse these costs.
*   **Return Authorization Required:** All international returns must be authorized by our customer service team. Please contact [support@inkwellandquill.com](mailto:support@inkwellandquill.com) with your order details to initiate the process.
*   **Customs Declarations:** When returning an item internationally, please clearly mark the package with "Returned Merchandise" to avoid potential customs charges. Failure to do so may result in delays or refusal of the return.
*   **Refunds:** Refunds for international returns will exclude original shipping charges.
*   **Exchanges:** Due to the complexities and costs of international shipping, exchanges for international orders may be handled on a case-by-case basis. In many instances, it may be more cost-effective for customers to return an item for a refund and place a new order for the desired item.

**Edge Cases & Customer Service Scenarios:**

*   **Lost or Damaged Shipments (Inbound):** If an item arrives damaged or is lost in transit during the initial delivery, please contact us immediately with photographic evidence (for damage) and your order number. We will arrange for a replacement or refund.
*   **Defective Items:** If you receive a book with a printing error (e.g., missing pages, upside-down text) or a defective stationery/gift item, please contact us within **7 days** of receipt. We will arrange for a replacement or a full refund, including return shipping costs.
*   **Incorrect Item Received:** If you receive an incorrect item due to our error, please contact us within **7 days** of receipt. We will provide a prepaid shipping label for you to return the incorrect item and will ship the correct item to you promptly.
*   **Proof of Purchase:** For all returns and exchanges, a valid proof of purchase (original receipt, order confirmation email, or loyalty account lookup) is required. If you are unable to provide proof of purchase, we may offer store credit at the current selling price of the item, at the discretion of Inkwell & Quill Books.
*   **Partial Returns:** If you purchased a bundle or set and wish to return only a portion of it, the return will be processed at the individual item's price within the bundle. Restocking fees may apply if the partial return results in an opened bundle.
*   **Third-Party Purchases:** If you purchased an Inkwell & Quill Books item through a third-party vendor (e.g., Amazon, a marketplace), you must adhere to that vendor's return policy. We cannot directly process returns for items purchased through other retailers.
*   **"Buyer's Remorse" vs. Return Eligibility:** Our policies are designed to be fair. While we understand "buyer's remorse," returns are primarily for situations where the customer is genuinely unsatisfied with the product's condition or quality as per our policies.
*   **Customer Abuse of Policy:** Inkwell & Quill Books reserves the right to refuse returns or exchanges if we suspect a pattern of abuse or fraudulent activity.

We strive to make your experience with Inkwell & Quill Books as enjoyable as possible. If you have any questions or require assistance with a return or exchange, please do not hesitate to contact our friendly customer service team at [support@inkwellandquill.com](mailto:support@inkwellandquill.com) or by calling us at [Your Phone Number].
