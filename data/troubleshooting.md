### **I. General Safety Warnings and Precautions**

Before attempting any troubleshooting, please ensure the customer understands and adheres to the following:

*   **Electrical Safety:**
    *   Never attempt to open or repair any electronic device yourself.

    *   Keep small parts away from children.
*   **Data Security:**
    *   Always advise customers to back up their important data (e-books, notes, personal files) before attempting major troubleshooting steps like factory resets. Inkwell & Quill Books is not responsible for data loss.
*   **Environmental Considerations:**
    *   Operate devices within the recommended temperature range (typically 0째C to 35째C or 32째F to 95째F).
    *   Avoid direct sunlight for extended periods, especially for e-readers with e-ink displays.

### **II. Diagnostic Procedures**

These are initial steps to gather information about the problem.

1.  **Gather Information:**
    *   **Product Model:** Ask the customer for the exact model name and serial number (often found on the back of the device or in settings).
    *   **Operating System/Firmware Version:** For software or devices with an OS, ask for the current version. This is crucial for identifying known issues.
    *   **Specific Error Messages:** Ask the customer to read any error messages verbatim.
    *   **When did the issue start?** Was it after an update, a new installation, or a physical event?
    *   **What were they doing when the issue occurred?**
    *   **Has anything changed recently?** (e.g., new software installed, internet provider changed, new accessories)

2.  **Basic Device Status Check:**
    *   **Power:** Is the device on? Is the battery charged?
    *   **Connections:** Are cables (power, USB) securely connected? Is Wi-Fi enabled and connected to a known network?
    *   **Storage:** Is there sufficient free storage space on the device?

3.  **Reproduce the Issue:**
    *   If possible, ask the customer to guide you through the steps they take that lead to the problem. This helps isolate the cause.
