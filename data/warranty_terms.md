### 3. What's Covered and Excluded

#### 3.1. What IS Covered:

This warranty covers manufacturing defects, which are flaws in the materials or workmanship present at the time of sale. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   **Binding Defects:** Pages coming loose, spine cracking or splitting due to improper binding, pages falling out.
*   **Cover Material Defects:** Significant peeling, cracking, or delamination of the cover material that is not a result of external damage.
*   **Printing Errors:** Missing pages, duplicated pages, inverted pages, significant ink smudging or missing text that renders the book unreadable.
*   **Faulty Components (for Accessories):** Malfunctioning electronic components (e.g., reading light LEDs not working, battery not holding a charge beyond reasonable use), structural failure of bookends not caused by misuse.
*   **Paper Defects (Journals/Notebooks):** Excessive paper tearing due to manufacturing weakness, significant inconsistency in paper quality affecting usability (e.g., widespread ghosting or bleed-through beyond industry standards).

**Customer Service Agent Note:** Focus on whether the issue is a result of how the product was *made*, not how it was *used*.

#### 3.2. What IS NOT Covered:

This warranty does not cover damage or defects arising from:

*   **Normal Wear and Tear:** Fading of pages or covers over time, minor scuffs, creases, or bends on covers and pages from regular handling and use.
*   **Accidental Damage:** Drops, spills, tears, punctures, burns, water damage, or other physical damage caused by the Customer or a third party.
*   **Improper Use or Handling:** Using the product in a manner inconsistent with its intended purpose, such as bending the spine excessively, overstuffing journals, or using inappropriate cleaning agents.
*   **Unauthorized Modifications or Repairs:** Any alterations, repairs, or attempts to repair the product by anyone other than an authorized Inkwell & Quill representative.
*   **Environmental Factors:** Damage caused by extreme temperatures, humidity, direct sunlight, or other environmental conditions.
*   **Storage Issues:** Damage resulting from improper storage, such as stacking heavy objects on books or storing in damp environments.
*   **Natural Variations:** Minor imperfections in paper texture, color variations in leather or fabric covers, or slight variations in printing that do not affect the overall quality or readability.
*   **Personal Preferences:** Dissatisfaction with minor aesthetic details that do not constitute a manufacturing defect.
*   **Loss or Theft:** This warranty does not cover lost or stolen items.
*   **Third-Party Products:** Products not manufactured or branded by Inkwell & Quill, even if sold alongside our products.
*   **Digital Products:** As stated in Section 2.

**Customer Service Agent Note:** If the customer describes damage that sounds like an accident (e.g., "my dog chewed it," "I dropped it in the bath"), it is likely not covered. Carefully probe for details to distinguish between a manufacturing defect and accidental damage.

### 4. Warranty Claim Procedures

To initiate a warranty claim, please follow these steps:

1.  **Gather Information:**
    *   Your original order number or proof of purchase (receipt, order confirmation email).
    *   The product name and SKU (if available).
    *   A clear description of the defect or issue.
    *   Photographs or a short video clearly showing the defect. This is crucial for assessment.

2.  **Contact Customer Support:**
    *   **Email:** Send your claim details and supporting documentation to [warranty@inkwellandquill.com](mailto:warranty@inkwellandquill.com). Please use the subject line: "Warranty Claim - [Your Order Number]".
    *   **Phone:** Call us at [Customer Service Phone Number] during our business hours ([Business Hours, e.g., Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 5 PM EST]).
    *   **Website:** Visit our "Contact Us" or "Support" page at [Website URL] and fill out the warranty claim form.

3.  **Claim Assessment:**
    *   Our customer service team will review your submitted information.
    *   We may request additional information or clearer photos/videos if the initial submission is insufficient.
    *   For certain complex issues or high-value items, we may ask you to ship the product to us for in-person inspection (see section 5).

4.  **Resolution:**
    *   Once your claim is approved, we will inform you of the next steps, which typically involve repair or replacement.

**Customer Service Agent Note:**
*   Be empathetic and understanding. The customer is experiencing an issue with a product they purchased.
*   **Document EVERYTHING.** Log all communication, submitted evidence, and any decisions made in the customer's account or case file.
*   If a customer cannot provide proof of purchase, explore alternative methods for verification (e.g., shipping address, email used for the order). If verification is impossible, the claim may be denied.
*   When requesting photos/videos, be specific about what you need to see. For example, "Please provide a close-up photo of the loose binding on page 50" or "A short video showing the reading light not turning on."
*   Set clear expectations for response times. Typically, acknowledge receipt of a claim within 24-48 business hours and provide an update on the assessment within 3-5 business days.

### 5. Repair vs. Replacement Policies

The decision to repair or replace a product will be made by Inkwell & Quill at our sole discretion, based on the nature of the defect, the product category, and the availability of parts or replacement units.

*   **Repair:** If the defect is minor and can be effectively repaired, Inkwell & Quill may choose to repair the product. This may involve professionally re-binding a book, replacing faulty components in an accessory, or other appropriate corrective measures.
    *   **Shipping for Repair:** If a product needs to be shipped for repair, Inkwell & Quill will provide a pre-paid shipping label for domestic returns. The Customer will be responsible for packaging the item securely.
    *   **Turnaround Time for Repair:** Repairs typically take 2-4 weeks from the date the product is received by our repair facility. We will keep the customer informed of the progress.

*   **Replacement:** If the defect is substantial, cannot be economically repaired, or if a repair is not feasible, Inkwell & Quill will replace the product with a new, comparable item.
    *   **Matching Products:** We will strive to replace the defective product with an identical item. If the original item is no longer available, we will offer a comparable product of equal or greater value.
    *   **Shipping for Replacement:** Inkwell & Quill will cover the cost of shipping the replacement product to the Customer.

**Customer Service Agent Note:**
*   **For books:** If the defect is within the first 10-20 pages, it might be considered a replacement rather than a repair, especially for new releases. If it's a binding issue towards the middle or end of a well-used book, it might be repairable if itâ€™s a significant defect.
*   **For accessories:** If a reading light's LED fails, it's likely a replacement. If a bookend has a minor cosmetic scratch that can be buffed out, repair might be an option.
*   When offering a replacement, clearly communicate any differences in edition or cover art if an exact match isn't available.
*   Always advise customers to package items securely for return shipping to prevent further damage in transit.

### 6. Extended Warranty Options

Inkwell & Quill Books may offer optional extended warranty plans for select products, particularly our specialty editions, journals, and book accessories.

*   **Availability:** Extended warranty options will be clearly advertised on our website and at the point of purchase for eligible products.
*   **Coverage:** Extended warranties typically mirror the terms of the standard warranty but extend the coverage period (e.g., an additional 1 or 2 years beyond the standard warranty). Specific coverage details will be provided with each extended warranty purchase.
*   **Purchase:** Extended warranties must be purchased at the same time as the product or within a specified timeframe (e.g., 30 days of purchase).
*   **Claim Process:** Claims under an extended warranty follow the same procedure as outlined in Section 4.

**Customer Service Agent Note:**
*   Familiarize yourself with the terms of any current extended warranty offerings.
*   When a customer inquires about an extended warranty, clearly explain its duration, what it covers, and any exclusions.
*   If a customer wishes to purchase an extended warranty after the initial purchase period, inform them if it's possible and the process for doing so.

### 7. International Warranty Coverage

Inkwell & Quill Books offers limited international warranty coverage.

*   **Coverage Scope:** Our warranty for international customers covers manufacturing defects as defined in Section 3.1.
*   **Claim Process:** International customers must initiate claims via email at [warranty@inkwellandquill.com](mailto:warranty@inkwellandquill.com) with clear documentation of the defect.
*   **Shipping Costs:**
    *   **Return Shipping:** International customers are responsible for the cost of shipping the defective product back to Inkwell & Quill. We recommend using a trackable and insured shipping method.
    *   **Replacement/Repaired Product Shipping:** Inkwell & Quill will cover the cost of shipping a replacement or repaired product back to the original international shipping address.
*   **Customs and Duties:** Customers are responsible for any customs duties, import taxes, or fees that may be incurred for both the return shipment and the shipment of a replacement or repaired product.
*   **Limitations:** Due to logistical challenges and varying regulations, Inkwell & Quill reserves the right to deny warranty service for certain regions or for specific product types if deemed unfeasible.

**Customer Service Agent Note:**
*   Be extra diligent when assessing international claims. The cost of shipping can be significant.
*   Clearly explain the customer's responsibility for return shipping costs and any potential customs fees *before* they ship the item back.
*   Advise international customers to package items extremely well to minimize the risk of damage during transit.
*   When providing a return shipping address for international claims, ensure it is complete and accurate, including any required postal codes or country indicators.

### 8. Warranty Transfer Policies

Inkwell & Quill Books' warranty is transferable to a new owner of the product.

*   **Transfer Condition:** The warranty transfer is valid only if the product is transferred to a new owner within the original warranty period.
*   **Notification Requirement:** To ensure a smooth transfer, the original purchaser should ideally notify Inkwell & Quill of the transfer by providing the new owner's name and contact information, along with the original order details. This can be done by emailing [support@inkwellandquill.com](mailto:support@inkwellandquill.com) with the subject "Warranty Transfer."
*   **Proof of Purchase:** The new owner must retain the original proof of purchase (receipt or order confirmation) to make a warranty claim.
*   **Limitations:** Any extended warranty purchased separately may have its own transferability terms, which would be outlined in that specific agreement.

**Customer Service Agent Note:**
*   If a new owner contacts you without prior notification, you can still process the claim if they provide the original proof of purchase and the product is within its warranty period.
*   When processing a claim from a new owner, confirm the original purchase date using the provided proof of purchase.

### 9. How to Maintain Warranty Validity

To ensure your Inkwell & Quill Books product remains covered under warranty, please adhere to the following:

*   **Handle with Care:** Treat all products with the care expected for books and literary items. Avoid rough handling, bending spines excessively, or exposing them to harsh conditions.
*   **Proper Storage:** Store books upright or flat, away from direct sunlight, excessive moisture, extreme temperatures, and pests. Store journals and accessories in a clean, dry environment.
*   **Use as Intended:** Use products only for their intended purposes. For example, use journals for writing, reading lights for illumination, and bookends for supporting books.
*   **Keep Proof of Purchase:** Always retain your original receipt or order confirmation. This is essential for initiating any warranty claim.
*   **Avoid Unauthorized Repairs:** Do not attempt to repair or modify the product yourself or through an unauthorized third party. Any such action will void the warranty.

**Customer Service Agent Note:**
*   When a customer complains about a defect, it's good practice to gently remind them of proper care and handling without sounding accusatory. For example, "We're sorry to hear about the binding issue. To help prevent this in the future, please ensure books are not forced open too wide."
*   Reinforce the importance of keeping the proof of purchase.
